# Systems Integration – Rotational Reporting Sessions

## Overview

This activity is designed to deepen your understanding of modern Systems Integration technologies through:

- Structured group reporting
- Progressive topic mastery
- Active listening and accountability
- Scholarly competition
- Technical depth development

Each group will report for **30 minutes per session**.

There will be **6 groups** and **6 sessions (rounds)**.

Each group will rotate topics every meeting until all groups have covered all topics.

---

# Topics

The six core topics are:

1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
2. Docker and Containerization
3. Cloud Computing in AWS
4. Cloud Computing in Azure
5. Cloud Computing in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
6. Modern API-First Stack (SaaS & Microservices Integration)

---

# Core Rule of Rotation

At each meeting:

- Every group presents a different topic.
- In the next meeting, each group moves to the **next topic in sequence**.
- No group may repeat content already presented by the previous group on that topic.
- Each new group must:
  - Extend
  - Deepen
  - Provide new perspectives
  - Add technical demonstrations
  - Introduce real-world case studies
  - Provide architectural analysis

This structure ensures:
- Active listening
- Accountability
- Progressive mastery
- Competitive depth

---

# Reporting Duration

- 30 minutes per group
- 20–25 minutes presentation
- 5–10 minutes Q&A

---

# Rotation Schedule (6 Groups × 6 Sessions)

| Session | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | Group 4 | Group 5 | Group 6 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Round 1** | CI/CD | Docker | AWS | Azure | GCP | API-First Stack |
| **Round 2** | Docker | AWS | Azure | GCP | API-First Stack | CI/CD |
| **Round 3** | AWS | Azure | GCP | API-First Stack | CI/CD | Docker |
| **Round 4** | Azure | GCP | API-First Stack | CI/CD | Docker | AWS |
| **Round 5** | GCP | API-First Stack | CI/CD | Docker | AWS | Azure |
| **Round 6** | API-First Stack | CI/CD | Docker | AWS | Azure | GCP |

By the end of Round 6:
- Every group has reported on all 6 topics.
- Every topic has been handled by all 6 groups.
- Each iteration builds on the previous one.

---

# Depth Progression Requirement

Each successive group handling a topic must elevate the discussion level.

Example progression for CI/CD:

Group 1: Fundamentals  
Group 2: Toolchains (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)  
Group 3: CI/CD Architecture Design  
Group 4: Security & DevSecOps Integration  
Group 5: Scaling Pipelines in Enterprise Systems  
Group 6: Case Studies + Failure Analysis + Optimization

The same progressive deepening applies to all topics.

---

# Required Content Per Presentation

Each presentation must include:

1. Conceptual Overview
2. System Architecture Diagram
3. Real-world Use Case
4. Technical Stack Demonstration or Walkthrough
5. Integration Perspective (How it connects to other systems)
6. Limitations / Risks
7. Q&A Facilation

---

# Listening Accountability Mechanism

To encourage active listening:

- After each presentation, another randomly selected group will be asked to:
  - Summarize key insights
  - Ask a technical follow-up question
  - Identify one improvement opportunity

Failure to demonstrate listening may affect participation grading.

---

# Scholarly Competition Guidelines

Groups are encouraged to:

- Provide live demos
- Show system architecture diagrams
- Compare vendors
- Analyze trade-offs
- Provide deployment cost analysis
- Present performance benchmarks
- Conduct mini case analyses

The goal is not repetition — but intellectual escalation.

---

# Evaluation Criteria (High-Level)

Grading will consider:

- Technical Depth
- Clarity of Explanation
- Systems Integration Perspective
- Originality Beyond Previous Group
- Delivery and Engagement
- Handling of Q&A

---

# Professional Expectations

- No recycled slides from the previous group.
- No surface-level repetition.
- Proper citations for all diagrams and sources.
- Respectful but competitive academic conduct.

---

# Final Objective

By the end of 6 sessions, each group should:

- Be capable of designing an integrated system architecture
- Understand CI/CD pipelines
- Understand containerization and orchestration
- Compare cloud providers: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Design API-first and microservices architectures
- Think like Systems Integration engineers

---

Prepare thoroughly.  
Listen carefully.  
Build on each other.  
Compete professionally.
